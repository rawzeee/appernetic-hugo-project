		bio = "Tezos is a new decentralized blockchain that governs itself by establishing a true digital commonwealth. It facilitates formal verification, a technique which mathematically proves the correctness of the code governing transactions and boosts the security of the most sensitive or financially weighted smart contracts.
		<break> Tezos has been in development for three years and is being led by Kathleen Breitman, Arthur Breitman, and a development team located in Paris. The advisors to the project are Zooko Wilcox, the founder of ZCash, Emin GÃ¼n Sirer, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University, and Andrew Miller, Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. There is a working testnet (access is available upon request), and the code is available for review on GitHub.
