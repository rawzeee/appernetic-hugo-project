It features a built-in governance mechanism that gives stakeholders the power to make decisions on protocol upgrades which are automatically pushed on the blockchain. In addition, Tezos features a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and a smart contract language designed to facilitate formal verification. This ensures that changes to the software happen in a safe, secure, and transparent way without the risk of hard forks.</p><p>With a protocol written in OCaml and a new smart contract language called Michelson, Tezos makes security and nonambiguity our top concern.</p><p>For more information please review our:<br><br><a href="https://tezos.com/static/papers/white_paper.pdf">White paper</a><br>Position paper<br>Reddit</p>"
